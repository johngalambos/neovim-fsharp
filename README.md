# Neovim FSharp

This is a work in progress port of [vim-fsharp](https://github.com/fsharp/vim-fsharp) to Neovim's new plugin architecture.

It should provide better asychronous integration using [FsAutoComplete](https://github.com/fsharp/FsAutoComplete).


## Installation

Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

```
Plug 'johngalambos/neovim-fsharp', {'do': ':UpdateRemotePlugins', 'do': './install.py. }
```
